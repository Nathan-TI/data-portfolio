# Project 1: Ethiopia Market Prices Dashboard

This project analyzes market price trends for key commodities like Teff, Maize, and Wheat across major regions in Ethiopia. The goal was to uncover seasonal and regional price fluctuations and visualize them for easier interpretation.

## Dataset
- Simulated based on real public data sources like the World Bank and CSA Ethiopia.
- Contains price trends from six regions over six months.

## Tools Used
- Python for data cleaning and trend analysis
- Tableau Public for interactive dashboard
- GitHub for documentation and version control

## Key Takeaways
- Regional disparities exist in commodity pricing
- Trends align with seasonal patterns and supply fluctuations

## Next Steps
We plan to incorporate live data from CSA or World Bank APIs, and automate the pipeline. Future enhancements include forecast modeling and inflation adjustment.
